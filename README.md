LoadMore
========

A simple example of the "scroll to load more" paradigm that I see on the web. Useful to minimize the amount of network resources accessed on initial page load along with minimizing elements attached to the DOM unless requested by the user (lazy loading).

Main code is in scripts/loadmore.js.

It can probably be abstracted further to handle any generic container / data set.

Feel free to use this as inspiration for your own web sites.
